<p>ELMS: Learning Network was an approach to structuring learning environments where the technology was flexible enough to be remixable on a per-course basis. This allowed for the following, emergent design pattern:</p>
<ul><li>Have an idea, spin up an idea, test an idea</li><li>Capture and refine that idea</li><li>Throw away the ones that fail, scale the ones that land</li></ul>
<p>This was possible because of building on top of Drupal + the unique nature of ELMS:LN in that it was almost like a flower opening up it's petals. The network diagram / snow-flake logo reflected what was possible with the system.</p>

<p>It was reasonably easy to describe, very difficult to setup. Also Drupal 7 which was empowering at first, moved on and became a boat anchor. It was effectively pushing toward the need for component architecture before that really stabilized, as well as microservice architecture before that was really a thing. The monolithic nature of the solution, along with staffing shortages, and the emergence of HAX, lead to the collapse of the project.</p>
<p>Still, ELMS:LN was a very interesting system that pushed me forward into areas I never thought possible. I learned automation and thinking in a heavily networked way to try and solve problems within this interesting space. It powered 100s of courses and served 100s of thousands of students, also having a very large deployment outside the university.</p>
<p>It served its purpose -- to automate away huge tasks associated with the work to pursue something bigger. HAX.</p>
