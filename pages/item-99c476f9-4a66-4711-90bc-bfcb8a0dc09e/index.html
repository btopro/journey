<p>I am awesome and you should probably know a bunch of other stuff about me.</p>
<p>Did you know that I can play the harmonica? Me neither but I bet if I tried I could. This is the skill of an artist I exhibit!</p>
<p>Anyway, if anything I am a bit odd and live two heavily integrated lives.</p>
<h2 id="header-6422c4f8-b186-9863-8e95-896b9c0fd6f4">Life one</h2>
<p>Coaching. I love coaching and mentorship. I get to live this through coaching youth hockey, but also by offering independent studies and internship work through <a href="https://haxtheweb.org/hax-lab" target="_blank">HAX Lab</a>. I love building up the next generation on and off the ice. Some accomplishments with this life:</p>
<ul><li>Seeing multiple students grow into successful contributors to their own community, work life, as well as the larger HAX community</li><li>Seeing hockey players grow into confident young people ready to take on the world</li><li>Winning the 2010 NCRHA Roller Hockey B Division Championship as a coach</li></ul>
<h2 id="header-08dcf8c3-9d75-8202-f2fd-23c69588e5e7">Life two</h2>
<p>Building in the classroom leading to building in the larger HAX ecosystem. I've been great at building community whether in Drupal / ELMS in the past, hockey community, or as is my focus now the classroom community and growing HAX by growing the next generation of learners. I enjoy teaching web development and am often told that my methods are difficult but force growth and learning by asking questions and leaving an empty space for students to have to stumble through the dark a bit, discover and explore what's possible.</p>
<ul><li>I've taught since 2019 for Penn State</li><li>We've seen 11+ Semesters of contribution to HAX while teaching students how to work on the web!</li></ul>
<p>You can go more in depth with the various aspects of "me" with a variety of resources.</p>
