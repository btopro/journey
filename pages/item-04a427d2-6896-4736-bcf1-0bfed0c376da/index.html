<p>Not just the current thing, the forever thing. I can without a doubt say that this is where my work was ultimately to lead; the formation of a sustainable web development community with the goal of reducing the cost and complexity of development on the web.</p>
<p>Part class, part project, part club, part activism, part mission -- HAX The Web is many thing due to the transformative nature of a very simple idea - we can create new HTML tags and share them.</p>
<p>These tags then inform what is now a 600+ tag registry of reusable pieces that can do everything on the web from building an icon to becoming a web editor. The CMS you are currently viewing is built entirely out of reusable pieces which can be leveraged in other CMSs or to power radically different looking websites.</p>
<p>HAX needs no back end, can be edited locally or on a server, can be built to a 'static' format or powered by CDNs in order to remain up to date with the latest design and accessibility improvements. It is a transformative concept, a network, a life style, and I am proud to live it every day.</p>
