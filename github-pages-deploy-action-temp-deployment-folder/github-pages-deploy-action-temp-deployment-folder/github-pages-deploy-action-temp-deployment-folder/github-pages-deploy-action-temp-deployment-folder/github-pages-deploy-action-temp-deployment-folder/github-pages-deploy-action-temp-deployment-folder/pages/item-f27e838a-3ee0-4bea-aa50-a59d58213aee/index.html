<p>My (way too long and took forever to write) Masters work research paper. In learning Drupal, building ELMS and then growing that into ELMS:LN, I was able to do a research study associated with the platform. The interesting thing about that research "platform" though.. is that I was shaping the adoption story through intentional and unintentional actions. Could "we" overwhelm existing, stasis forms of publishing via old CMS tech, by replacing it with a community driven, more modern approach.</p>
<p>As it turned out, we could and quickly, by doing work for free. Free was not sustainable, but it was enough to kick start the community and generate a problem for the existing solution space such that eventually people began having so much success with the new CMS that they started to divest from the old. Believing everyone was moving to "The Next Thing" through this free donation of effort, the community was able to shift to what it needed as opposed to what it felt it was forced to use.</p>
<p>A bizarre way of going about a paper. I don't generally suggest taking 8 years, writing in the 1st and 3rd person, and being told "finish this this year or your out" but hey, it was my way of doing it certainly. Also I give my 11 year old less crap about not finishing things in a timely manner because sometimes it takes time.</p>
<p>This research forever changed how I view the world, what is possible, and lead me toward who I wanted to become -- a change agent using technology as a vehicle.</p>
